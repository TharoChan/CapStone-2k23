# CapStone-2k23
 In the depths of study and toil,
Through the labyrinth of research and soil,
The Capstone Project looms ahead,
A grand finale to this journey we've led.

 We seek to showcase all we've learned,
To prove our skills, our knowledge earned,
To show the world we're ready to soar,
That we've grown and can do much more.

 Endless nights we've poured in,
Into our projects, with sweat and chin,
To bring to life our grand design,
To create something truly divine.

 We've presented, and defended our work,
With nerves that threatened to go berserk,
But we stood tall and made our mark,
For this Capstone Project, our final spark.

 Now we bask in the glory of it all,
Our triumphs, big and small,
And we step forward into the unknown,
Ready to take on whatever's shown.

 The Capstone Project, our grand finale,
A journey to cherish, to always rally,
A symbol of all that we can achieve,
Our potential unleashed, and forever believe.
